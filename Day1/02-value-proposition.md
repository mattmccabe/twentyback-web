## Rationale for Primary Choice

The primary value proposition was chosen because it:

1. **Clearly quantifies the benefit** - "10-20 hours per week" gives a concrete expectation
2. **Addresses the core pain point** - Time being consumed by administrative tasks
3. **Speaks to the target audience** - Uses "solopreneurs" which resonates with our ICPs
4. **Highlights key features** - Mentions the three main automation areas (quotes, scheduling, follow-ups)
5. **Focuses on the outcome** - Emphasizes focusing on core work and business growth
6. **Uses accessible language** - Avoids technical jargon while remaining professional

This value proposition directly addresses the common thread across all our ICPs: successful solo service professionals who are limited by time spent on administrative tasks rather than revenue-generating work.
