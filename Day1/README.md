## Completed Tasks Overview

### ✅ Task 1: Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs)
**File:** [01-ideal-customer-profiles.md](./01-ideal-customer-profiles.md)

Created three detailed ICPs:

- **Sarah Chen** - Mobile Auto Detailer (2-4 years experience, $60K-$95K revenue)  
- **Tom Williams** - Handyman Service Owner (8-12 years experience, $85K-$140K revenue)

Each profile includes demographics, pain points, goals, and behavioral characteristics specific to solo service professionals overwhelmed by administrative tasks.

### ✅ Task 2: Value Proposition
**File:** [02-value-proposition.md](./02-value-proposition.md)

**Primary Value Proposition:**
*"TwentyBack gives solopreneurs their time back by automating quotes, scheduling, and customer follow-ups, so you can focus on what you do best while growing your business 10-20 hours per week."*

Includes 4 alternative variations and detailed rationale for the primary choice, emphasizing quantifiable time savings and core business benefits.

### ✅ Task 3: Pain Points & Outcomes
**File:** [03-pain-points-outcomes.md](./03-pain-points-outcomes.md)

Identified 5 critical pain points with corresponding positive outcomes:
1. Delayed response to customer inquiries → Instant 24/7 automated responses
2. Time-consuming manual scheduling → Automated scheduling system
3. Inconsistent follow-up communication → Systematic automated follow-ups
4. Administrative work consuming personal time → Evenings/weekends freed up
5. Missed revenue opportunities → Never miss an inquiry with 24/7 automation

### ✅ Task 4: Landing Page Headlines
**File:** [04-landing-page-headlines.md](./04-landing-page-headlines.md)

### ✅ Task 5: Brand Name Selection
**File:** [05-brand-name.md](./05-brand-name.md)
